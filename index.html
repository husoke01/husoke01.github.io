  <h2>Info</h2>
  <p>Hi! My name is Keegan Husom. I'm a current first year student at Luther College. I played hockey in high school for five years, and tennis during my senior year. I had a lot of fun playing high school sports. Sadly I don't play any sports in college, I wish that I did. I've learned a lot from sports. I lost a ton a weight playing hockey. It changed my life in serious way. I continue to workout at the Legends Club at Luther. Something about getting a good sweat is the best feeling in the world. It puts a smile on my face.</p>
