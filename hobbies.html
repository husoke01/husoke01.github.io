    <p>I played hockey basically all my life. I started playing varsity hockey in 8th grade. I learned a lot from the sport. I learned to be myself, to be truly myself. To not act like someone else. Hockey has got me in the condition that I am in right now. I couldn't feel any better about myself.</p>
    
    <h1>Tennis</h1>

    <p>I played tennis my senior year, because why not? I loved to play the sport. A lot of people think it's a easy sport to play. Let me correct you, it's not. There are so many fundamentals that go into the sport. I'm going to continue playing the sport the rest of my life. It is really fun and I would recommend it to anyone.</p>

    <p>I love to play paintball often, but with the sport being too expensive. It's hard to get out and play. I play paintball because I want to get the adrenaline rush, it feels so awesome. I have all my own gear and I would like to get out and play one more time before it snows. I play with some of my friends, they got me to start playing paintball. Everyone who hasn't played paintball, I highly recommend eveyone play just for the experience.</p>
