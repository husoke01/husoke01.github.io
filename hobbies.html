    <p>I played hockey for five years. I started in 8th grade, backing up varsity. I learned a lot from the sport. I learned to be myself, to be truly myself. To not act like someone else.</p>
    
    <h1>Tennis</h1>

    <p>I played tennis my senior year, because why not? I loved to play the sport. A lot of people think it's a easy sport to play. Let me correct you, it's not. There are so many fundamentals that go into the sport.</p>

    <h1>Paintball</h1>

    <p>I love to play paintball often, but with the sport being too expensive. It's hard to get out and play. I play paintball because I want to get the adrenaline rush, it feels so awesome. I have all my own gear and I would like to get out and play one more time before it snows. I play with some of my friends, they got me to start playing paintball. Everyone who hasn't played paintball, I highly recommend eveyone play just for the experience.</p>
