    <p>I played hockey for five years. I started in 8th grade, backing up varsity. I learned a lot from the sport. I learned to be myself, to be truly myself. To not act like someone else.</p>

    <p>I played tennis my senior year, because why not? I loved to play the sport. A lot of people think it's a easy sport to play. Let me correct you, it's not. There are so many fundamentals that go into the sport.</p>
